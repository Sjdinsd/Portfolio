# Development Template
## About
This is a template used for reactive games. Made by yours truly, this project serves as the tip of the iceberg for what Im capable of doing. This template is mainly event based and packages aside is 100% written by me. Feel free to use if you come across this.

## What to Expect
This template focues on request and event based controllers, singletons, etc.. Look at the module loader and any other batteries that may be included, will help when developing with this template.
